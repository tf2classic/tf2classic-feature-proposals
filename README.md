# tf2classic-feature-proposals
Have an idea for a new addition or change to the game? Post it here!

Note that weapon suggestions are not needed, as the development team already has a list of weapons to experiment with and they don't need help coming up with new weaponry. No more weapons from live TF2 will be added, and cosmetics will not be added to the game either.

Please make sure that your suggestion has not already been made before creating it. Duplicates, or proposals that are only a slight variation on an existing proposal, will be closed.
